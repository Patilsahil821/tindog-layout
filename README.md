some important notes;

1. when you do position absolute of an element then it will come out from the html's original form and the next
   component will take place of the current element's place.
2. if your define z-index -1 of any element then it will disappear because every element has z-index 0 and you did
   -1 so it will go behind all the element
3. z-index works only if they have positioned.
